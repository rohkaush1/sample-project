#create a git reporisoty/working directory folder
~ $ git init projects #only when you want to create a new git project in ur local


#clone the project, first goto the project folder
projects $ git clone URL
# it will create a git repository/directory of the complete project
projects $ ls
project-name/

projects $ cd project-name/
(master) project-name $ ls
#all the files of the project are listed

(master) project-name $ git status
on branch master
your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'

#if we did any changes in file and then check the status
(master) project-name $ git status

#it will show the untracked file and it's in working directory only. for commiting that changes
(master) project-name $ git add .

#now the file comes in staging area. If we want to commit that files in local repository
(master) project-name $ git commit -m "Adding changes"

#if we want to add and commit the files in a single cmd then use
(master) project-name $ git commit -am "Adding and commiting changes"

#for pushing the changes in actual remote master branch
(master) project-name $ git push origin master

#if I did the changes in a file 'level1.txt' and add these changes in staging area by using git add level1.txt
#Now I want to remove that file from staging area to back in working directory the
(master) project-name $ git reset head level1.txt

#If I want to remove the changes from level1.txt that I've done
(master) project-name $ git checkout level1.txt

#If I want to rename my file ===========================
(master) project-name $ git mv current-file-name new-file-name
#Afer that when you check the git status, then git renamed the file and move it in staging area
#But if you rename the file without using git cmd, by using git bash "mv" or by using operating system
#then git deleted the "current-file-name" file and create a new untracked file "new-file-name"
# now in 2nd case for adding this renamed file in stating area we need
(master) project-name $ git add -A
